## Project Overview
The Star Safari website is an innovative CMS-based platform that caters to both end users and content administrators. With a focus on delivering a seamless user experience, the website features a custom theme incorporating a blend of custom and third-party functionalities. It ensures compatibility across various browsers, devices, and platforms.

To meet the specific needs of both end users and content administrators, the website provides identified use cases and customisation components. These components empower administrators to easily configure the website, enabling it to cater to the identified use cases effectively. Additionally, an industry-standard agreement is assembled prior to production, ensuring a clear understanding between the client and the website development team.

To support site administrators, comprehensive documentation is provided, offering guidance on managing and maintaining the website. Moreover, a training session is conducted for the client to familiarize them with the content management system, empowering them to efficiently utilise its features.

The Star Safari website prioritizes CMS security best practices, ensuring the safety of user data and website functionality. The website seamlessly integrates into an online portfolio, showcasing its features and capabilities to a wider audience.
